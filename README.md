Trading Algorithms

I have developed and backtested several different trading algorithms. Note: None of these are live or profitable, and they are certainly not as reliable as traditional index investing.

In the process of building my first algorithms, I faced numerous challenges—like figuring out options filtering—and learned a lot from the experience.

Most of my strategies have been based on technical analysis. I haven't yet explored backtesting with a stronger focus on stock selection using fundamental analysis, but it's an area I'm interested in.

Lately, I've been more focused on isolating and understanding options Greeks, with the goal of profiting from their movements.
Double Earnings Calendar

The Double Earnings Calendar was a strategy designed to profit from the volatility buildup leading up to earnings announcements or other volatile events. It was essentially a delta-neutral trade aimed at capitalizing on vega.

Although I wasn't able to make it profitable, this strategy is worth exploring further in the future.
Earnings Trades

I tested several types of earnings-related trades. For example:

    Buying when the stock gapped up and crossed premarket highs.
    Shorting when it broke below the premarket range lows.
    Day 2 trades, where the idea was to enter if the stock took out the previous day's highs, betting on continued momentum.

I experimented with different stop-loss strategies, but often found it difficult to avoid arbitrary decisions.
